## Contributing
Feel free to help out with development by creating a pull request and it will be reviewed.

#### Guidelines
* All code commited should be original or properly credited.
* Please explain `in detail` on what you changed and why it would be beneficial.
* Try to separate new features. Large pull requests with multiple new features take longer to be merged.
* Try to follow the general style of the project.

If you have any questions about this, feel free to ask in the discord or by messaging Hoosiers (GooberTown#7384) on Discord.
